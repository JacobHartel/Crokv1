# This is more of a research project than an actual project. 

## It might say v1 but it's more like v3 because I am not familiar with this type of development

You get to learn with me.

The main premise is a clipboard tool for your LLM

You copy, then there will be a hotkey or simply hit a button in the icontray.

Could possibly become an extension to allow for context menu options to create more features in the prompt.

Likely just an alert popup with the returned string.

When navigating I hate switching to the browser or to a text editor

I would like a simple way to use my llm. 

One thing I haven't figured out is if it is simply personal use or if I'd like to get other people helping me
and giving me advice. I will most likely have it set up for BYOM (bring your own model, keep up buddy)

That's all for now, finally putting it on github so I appear as busy as I am. (had to use Azure repos this semester so haven't been in the git grindset)
